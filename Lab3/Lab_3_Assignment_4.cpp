Create a new class, e.g., RegularTypist, that publicly inherits from the existing Regular class.
Add new attributes or behaviors specific to the RegularTypist class if needed.
Repeat the process for another class, e.g., CasualTypist, that publicly inherits from the existing Casual class.
Test the new classes to ensure they inherit the properties of their base classes and have their own unique features.
