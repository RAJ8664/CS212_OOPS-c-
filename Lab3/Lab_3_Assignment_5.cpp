    Hybrid Inheritance:

    Identify two or more base classes that will participate in the hybrid inheritance.
    Create a new class, e.g., TeachingOfficer, that publicly inherits from two or more base classes (hierarchical or multi-level).
    If necessary, add additional attributes or behaviors to the derived class.
    Test the derived class to ensure it inherits properties from all its base classes and functions correctly.
